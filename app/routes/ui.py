📚 UI ROUTES - WEB INTERFACE FOR TASK MANAGEMENT:

🎯 BLUEPRINT PATTERN:
This file uses Flask's Blueprint pattern to organize related routes.
Blueprints allow modular application structure and URL prefixing.

🔄 ROUTE PATTERNS DEMONSTRATED:
- GET routes: Display forms and data (task_form, show_tasks, task_report)
- POST routes: Process form submissions (create_task, delete_task, complete_task)
- Redirects: Post-Redirect-Get pattern for form handling
- URL parameters: Dynamic routes with <int:task_id>
💡 VALIDATION STRATEGY:
- Frontend: HTML 'required' attribute (user experience)
- Backend: Python validation (security and data integrity)
- Error handling: Display messages to users

👉 FOR STUDENTS / GROUP PROJECT HINT:
- This file currently performs simple server-side validation in the controller (`ui.py`) for clarity in the lab.
- In larger or collaborative projects it's better to centralize validation in the service layer (e.g. `TaskService`) or a shared schema:
  - Pros: single source of truth, reuse across UI and API, easier to test, clearer contract for business rules.
  - Suggestion: have controllers perform only minimal syntactic checks (trim/required) and let `TaskService` raise a semantic `ValidationError` for domain rules.
  - Adopt a custom `ValidationError`, update tests and controllers to catch that class rather than broad `Exception`.


🔗 BACKEND INTEGRATION:
All routes use current_app.task_service for business logic,
maintaining separation between web layer and business layer.

def home():
    """
    Home page - redirect to task form.
    
    📚 STUDENT NOTE: This demonstrates a common web pattern where
    the root URL redirects to a more specific landing page.

@ui_bp.route("/tasks/new", methods=["GET", "POST"])
def task_submit():
    """
    Create new task - handles both form display and submission.
    
    📚 VALIDATION LAYERS EXPLAINED:
    1. Frontend (HTML): 'required' attribute prevents empty submission
    2. Backend (Python): Server-side validation ensures data integrity
    3. Business Logic: TaskService.add_task() may have additional rules
    
    This demonstrates the "defense in depth" security principle.

    📚 DATA FLOW: 
    1. Route calls TaskService.get_all_tasks()
    2. Service returns list of Task objects converted to dicts
    3. Template receives 'tasks' variable for rendering
    4. Jinja2 loops through tasks with {% for task in tasks %}
    
    This demonstrates the MVC pattern: Route (Controller) → Service (Model) → Template (View)

    📚 TECHNICAL CONCEPTS:
    - URL Parameters: <int:task_id> automatically converts to integer
    - HTTP Method: POST for destructive actions (RESTful design)
    - Error Handling: TaskService will raise exception if task not found
    - Redirect: Post-Redirect-Get pattern prevents duplicate submissions

def complete_task(task_id):
    """

    📚 BUSINESS LOGIC:
    - Calls TaskService.complete_task() which handles the state change
    - Service layer ensures business rules are followed
    - Database/storage layer persists the change
    - UI layer just orchestrates the flow

    📚 DATA ANALYTICS PATTERN:
    This route demonstrates a common business intelligence pattern:
    1. Fetch raw data (all tasks)
    2. Apply aggregation logic (count totals, completed, remaining)
    3. Pass calculated metrics to presentation layer
    
    🔍 PYTHON TECHNIQUES:
    - List comprehension: [t for t in tasks if t.get("completed", False)]
    - Safe dictionary access: t.get("completed", False) handles missing keys
    - Mathematical operations: remaining = total - completed
    
    📊 REAL-WORLD APPLICATIONS:
    - Dashboard KPIs in business applications
    - Analytics reporting in web applications
    - Data aggregation for charts and visualizations
