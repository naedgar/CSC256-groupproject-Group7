# Sprint 1 Issue – Group Project

## Parent Epic: Sprint 1 Completion (PR-1 Agile Documentation)

- *Title:* **Sprint 1 Agile Documentation & Project Reset**
- *Description:*

This Sprint establishes the foundation of the **Group Project phase** of TaskTracker. The team migrates the selected Individual Project into a new shared repository, resets all Agile documentation, and prepares the system for upcoming refactors, CI changes, and advanced testing.

### ✅ Sprint-Level Completion Criteria (Product Owner Level)

- Shared **Group GitHub repository** is created and base code is migrated.
- All **Agile documentation is recreated** for the Group Project:
  - Sprint Plan  
  - Test Plan  
  - Test Cases  
  - API Reference  
  - Architecture Diagram  
  - ERD & Class Diagram  
- **Hybrid test strategy documented** (markers + concern-based folders).
- **CI refactor plan documented** (separate workflows, conditional triggers).
- **Robot Framework strategy documented** (not fully implemented yet).
- **Traceability Matrix framework created**.
- Documentation reflects **team ownership**, not the Individual Project.

### ✅ Definition of Done (applies to each task)

- Documentation committed to GitHub
- All files follow course templates
- Peer-reviewed via Pull Request
- CI remains green
- Artifacts match current project structure
